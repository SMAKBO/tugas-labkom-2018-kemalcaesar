                <p>Carvone forms two mirror image forms or enantiomers: R-(–)-carvone, or L-carvone, has a sweetish minty smell, like spearmint leaves. Its mirror image, S-(+)-carvone, or D-carvone, has a spicy aroma with notes of rye, like caraway seeds. The fact that the two enantiomers are perceived as smelling different is evidence that olfactory receptors must contain chiral groups, allowing them to respond more strongly to one enantiomer than to the other. Not all enantiomers have distinguishable odors. Squirrel monkeys have also been found to be able to discriminate between carvone enantiomers.
                The two forms are also referred to by the older names of laevo (L) referring to R-(–)-carvone, and dextro (D) referring to S-(+)-carvone. </p>

                <p> (R)-Carvone is found in caraway. (R)-Carvone is a constituent of spearmint (Mentha crispa) costmary, kuromoji and other oils. (R)-Carvone is a flavouring ingredient. Carvone is a volatile terpenoid. Carvone is found in many essential oils and is very abundant in the seeds of caraway (Carum carvi). Carvone is occasionally found as a component of biological fluids in normal individuals. Caraway was used for medicinal purposes by the ancient Romans, but carvone was probably not isolated as a pure compound until Varrentrapp obtained it in1841. (R)-Carvone belongs to the family of Monocyclic Monoterpenes. These are monoterpenes containing 1 ring in the isoprene chain.</p>

                <p>(S)-Carvone is a volatile terpenoid. Carvone is found in many essential oils and is very abundant in the seeds of caraway (Carum carvi). (S)-Carvone is occasionally found as a component of biological fluids in normal individuals. Caraway was used for medicinal purposes by the ancient Romans, but carvone was probably not isolated as a pure compound until Varrentrapp obtained it in1841.</p>
