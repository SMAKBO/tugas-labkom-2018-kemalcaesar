                <h3>Carvone can be found in many places</h3>

<p>Let’s first have a look at what carvone is since it is a little complex. Carvone is a member of a family of chemicals called terpenoids. It is a natural component in several food items such as mint and caraway but it may also be used as a pesticide, food and feed flavouring, in personal care products, or, together with other active substances, as a zootechnical feed additive. So it could be expected to be around a fair bit.</p>

<p>There are actually two varieties of carvone that are mirror images of each other, R-(-)-carvone (also called l-carvone) and S-(+)-carvone (also called d-carvone), which can be recognised by their smell. R-carvone smells like spearmint and S-carvone smells like caraway so there is no price for guessing that R-carvone is a principle component of oils extracted from several species of mint and S-carvone a principal component of caraway seed oil and also dill seed oil and mandarin peel oil.</p>

<p>Caraway is one of the oldest herbs cultivated in Europe and was used for medicinal purposes by the ancient Romans without knowing about the specifics of carvone. As the compound most responsible for the flavour of caraway, dill and spearmint, carvone has been used for millennia in food. Both carvones are now used in the food and flavour industry. Wrigley’s Spearmint Gum is soaked in R-carvone and powdered with sugar.</p>

<p>S-carvone is used to prevent premature sprouting of potatoes during storage while R-carvone has been proposed for use as a mosquito repellent. R-carvone is also used for air freshening products, in personal care products, in aromatherapy and in alternative medicines.
</p>
<h2>So what is the problem?</h2>

<p>A little bit tricky since toxicity results are available only for S-carvone and we are exposed to much higher levels of R-carvone, about three times more. Although experimental animals died when given very high levels of S-carvone, more realistic dose levels caused damage to the liver. The Scientific Committee opinion used the liver damage to establish an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) of 0.6 mg/kg body weight per day for S-carvone, using an uncertainty factor of 100 based on the experimental animal results. An ADI for R-carvone could not be established because of the previously mentioned lack of toxicity data.</p>

<p>Question then is if we get close to the ADI for S-carvone and what to do with R-carvone. As a matter of fact children with the highest exposure to S-carvone come very close to the ADI. The largest contributors are food flavourings, personal care products and natural spices. The much higher intake of R-carvone, especially for adults, come from personal care products followed by food flavourings.</p>

 
                <p> English use of the term caraway dates back to at least 1440,[8] and is considered by Walter William Skeat to be of Arabic origin, though Gernot Katzer believes the Arabic al-karawya كراوية (cf. Spanish alcaravea) to be derived from the Latin carum.[7]
