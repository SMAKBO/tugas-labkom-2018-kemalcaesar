15 - R-carvone 		16-S-carvone
Chemical Formula: C10H14O		Chemical Formula:C10H14O	
 
Quick fact
Many people cannot distinguish between the odours of the R- and S-carvones whereas squirrel monkeys have been found to be able to discriminate between them!
About R-carvone and S-carvone
R-carvone is a member of a family of chemicals called terpenoids (see also #13 Nepetalactone and #17 Camphor). R-carvone is found naturally in many essential oils, but is most abundant in spearmint oil Mentha Spicata. Carvone has two mirror image structural forms or enantiomers (like #14 limonene): R-carvone smells like spearmint whereas its mirror image, S-carvone, smells like caraway or dill. The fact that the two enantiomers are perceived as smelling differently is proof that the olfactory (smell) receptors in your nose must contain chiral groups, allowing them to respond more strongly to one enantiomer than to the other. 
Uses of R-carvone and S-carvone
Both carvones are used in the food and flavour industry. R-Carvone is also used for air freshening products and, like many essential oils, oils containing carvones are used in aromatherapy and alternative medicine. As the compound most responsible for the flavour of spearmint, R-carvone has been used for millennia in food, e.g. Wrigley's Spearmint Gum is soaked in R-carvone and powdered with sugar. 

Carvone - optical isomers

Carvone provides a classic example of how isomerism can determine odour. Carvone exists as two optical isomers, D-carvone and L-carvone. These molecules are non-superimposable mirror images and are described as chiral. In the same way your left hand and right hand are non-superimposable mirror images of each other. Although the two molecules are very similar, their different arrangements of atoms in three-dimensional space give them quite different odours; the L- isomer smells of spearmint while the D- isomer smells of caraway. It may be that the odour receptors for these molecules are chiral too and are related in the same way as a left and right hand glove.

ANALYSIS OF THE CARVONES
The samples obtained by gas chromatography and centrifugation should be analyzed by the methods below. Compare your results with those obtained by someone who used a different oil. In addition, measure the optical rotations of the commercial samples of (+)-carvone and (-)-carvone.
Gas Chromatography. Determine the retention times of the components. Calculate the percentage composition of the carvone sample by the triangulation method. In this method, a GC peak is approximated as a triangle, the area of which is proportional to the amount of material detected. The area of the peak is approximately equal to � X (peak height) X (peak width at half-height).
Infrared Spectroscopy. Obtain the infrared spectrum of the (-)-carvone sample from spearmint or of the (+)-carvone sample from caraway. Also obtain the infrared spectrum of the (+)-limonene, which is found in both oils. Determine both spectra on neat samples. If absolutely necessary, you may add one drop of nujol to the sample and mix it thoroughly before running the spectrum.  The spectrum will contain extra C-H absorptions at around 3000 cm-1, however, as nujol (a.k.a. mineral oil) is a mixture of long chain aliphatic hydrocarbons.
Polarimetry. With the help of the T.A., measure the optical rotation of the (+)-carvone and (-)-carvone samples provided. Calculate the specific rotation of each compound (B&F, pp. 140-142). The concentration c will equal the density of the substances anaiyzed at 20 oC. The values are 0.9608 g/mL for (+)-carvone and 0.9593 g/mL for (-)-carvone. The literature values for the specific rotations are as follows:
[aD20] = +61.7' for (+)-carvone
[aD20] = -62.5' for (-)-carvone.
