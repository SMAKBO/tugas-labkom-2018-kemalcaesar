	<p>Carvone is a member of a family of chemicals called terpenoids. It is a natural component in several food items such as mint and caraway but it may also be used as a pesticide, food and feed flavouring, in personal care products, or, together with other active substances, as a zootechnical feed additive.

	<p> Many Kind Of Carvone
	There are actually two varieties of carvone that are mirror images of each other, R-(-)-carvone (also called l-carvone) and S-(+)-carvone (also called d-carvone), which can be recognised by their smell. R-carvone smells like spearmint and S-carvone smells like caraway so there is no price for guessing that R-carvone is a principle component of oils extracted from several species of mint and S-carvone a principal component of caraway seed oil and also dill seed oil and mandarin peel oil. </p>

	<p> S-carvone is used to prevent premature sprouting of potatoes during storage while R-carvone has been proposed for use as a mosquito repellent. R-carvone is also used for air freshening products, in personal care products, in aromatherapy and in alternative medicines.</p>

	<p> Uses of Carvone </p>
	In general carvones are used in the food industry, and in aromatherapy like many essential oils, it is also used in air fresheners for it pleasant smell. It also has several therapeutic effects that make it a perfect choice in the treatment of certain medical conditions.

<p> Carvone in Food
It has been used in food for over millennia. The very famous Wrigley’s Spearmint Gum uses natural spearmint oil that has been extracted from Mentha spicata, and the other spearmint flavored Life Savers use the same.
Carvone that has been extracted from dill and caraway have also been in use in the food industry. The famous European drink Kummel is created with a mixture of an extract from caraway and alcohol.</p>

Carvone in Agriculture:
It is commonly used in Netherlands to prevent the sprouting of potatoes that have been kept in storage.
A study was conducted to understand the antifungal activity of carvone on potato tubers and other plant diseases, it was also meant to analyze the suppression of sprout in potatoes.
The results suggested that during in-vitro experiments, carvone exhibited antifungal activity towards various fungal species. Thus carvone has taken the trade name ‘talent’ to serve as an antifungal agent in the treatment of potato tubers in Netherlands.

Carvone as a Pesticide:
The extract of carvone is seen to be effective as a mosquito repellent, and at present it is being reviewed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to check its potency and safety as a pesticide.

Carvone & its Therapeutic Uses:
Carvone displays biological activities as an expectorant tonic, disinfectant, cardiac, stomachic, astringent, carminative, diuretic, and digestive stimulant.

Carvone as a Relaxant:
Carvone is a major constituent of the oil extracted from the caraway seed and is seen in huge quantities with a percentage as far as 99%. As a relaxant it helps relieve from stress, emotional exhaustion, and clear respiratory tracts by acting as an expectorant in the treatment of coughs, bronchitis, and bronchial asthma.
In the treatment of laryngitis and sore throats it helps by flushing out the toxins to aid in a speedy recovery. It aids in relaxing the digestive system and in the treatment of stomach colic, gastric spasms, flatulence, and nervous digestion. It’s also used in clearing the urinary tract as well.
